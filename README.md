# HotelManagement-hk
Java OOP-based project serves as a comprehensive system for managing hotel operations. It allows users to handle tasks such as saving customer information, reserving rooms across four categories, placing food orders for specific rooms, canceling reservations, and generating bills. The tool also includes features for checking room details and availability. It operates through a menu-driven interface that remains active until the user chooses to exit. Data persistence is achieved through file handling, ensuring that customer information, room reservations, and food orders are saved when the program closes. Upon restarting, the program reads the file to restore the hotel's previous state. File writing is handled in a separate thread to enable parallel processing. A custom exception is triggered if a user attempts to reserve a room that is already booked. Comprehensive exception handling is implemented to manage any unexpected issues.
